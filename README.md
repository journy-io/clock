Consume time as a service.

## ðŸ’¾ Installation

You can use your package manager (`npm` or `yarn`) to install:

```bash
npm install --save @journyio/clock
```
or
```bash
yarn add @journyio/clock
```

## ðŸ”Œ Getting started

First, [read this blogpost](https://blog.frankdejonge.nl/being-in-control-of-time-in-php/) to understand the reasoning behind this approach.

Let's say we have a class that creates a user:

```ts
import { DateTime } from "luxon";
import { Clock } from "./Clock";

class User {
  constructor(/* ... */ private readonly createdAt: DateTime) {}

  getCreatedAt() {
    return this.createdAt;
  }
}

class UserService {
  constructor(private readonly clock: Clock) {}

  create(/* ... */): User {
    return new User(
      /* ... */
      this.clock.getUTCTime()
    );
  }
}
```

In our tests we can use `ClockFixed` to control the current time:

```ts
const now = DateTime.utc();
const clock = new ClockFixed(now);
const userService = new UserService(clock);
const user = userService.create(/* ... */);

expect(user.getCreatedAt()).toEqual(now);
```

In our normal code we can use `ClockSystem`:

```ts
import { ClockSystem } from "./ClockSystem";

const userService = new UserService(new ClockSystem());
```

By depending on `Clock` we can consume time as a service (so that we're in control of time). Normally we would need to rely on magic or use `setTimeout` to test code that uses the current time. 

## ðŸ’¯ Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
